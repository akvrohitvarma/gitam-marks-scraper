# GITAM Marks Scraper

This software helps Individuals/Teachers to scrape and store marks
in an excel sheet to make it easier to view marks, calculate class average,
etc. This tool is built on a Command Line Interface, unlike my previous
tool [RONEE](https://akvrv.com/), I believe this type of Interface will be suitable for this
software since it reduces memory usage than compared to a
GUI with bells and whistles, this software is straight to point, 
easy and very powerful (I actually made a lot of effort to optimize)

This Software is Free to Use as an individual, but modifying, tampering
this software is a serious offence

I did not intend to include any trojan, backdoor or ransomware to
this software, if your antivirus detects that my software is malicious
it is purely a fluke, I do not intend to cause harm to any individual/system

## FAQ

#### Why is the software not running in my Mac machine?

This project is developed for windows users in mind, but a Mac version is
well under development, wait for updates

#### Is this illegal?

This software only fetches you publicly available data, there is no illegal
processes happening, that publicly hosted data will be fetched for Data Analysis
which is useful for Professors/Teachers

#### Where is the source code?

Yes, I believe and support open source, I built this software for open source
but due to some complications, the code which I wrote can be misused for other reasons
if made public, hence I didn't openly release the source code to the public, but if you
really need to see the source, I will surely do it, but I will not give the files for
redistribution, modification, unauthorised release etc.

Please read the [licence](https://github.com/akvrohitvarma/gitam-marks-scraper/blob/master/LICENSE) carefully

(publicly available student data must be used carefully)

#### Is it virus? Is it a Trojan?

I never worked to make this Software as a Trojan or a Virus, 
for the amount of work and effort I kept in this tool, I never 
intended to make/bind a malware trojan to harm others, the only reason
I didn't release the source code is because I don't want to tamper privacy 
of others.

You can install [Glasswire](https://www.glasswire.com/) or [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
and analyze the requests made by my software, the only request it makes is to the 
results server, you can scan my software in sandboxes like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
but beware there maybe false positives saying my software is a malware, because I don't own any software firm, I'm still a student

You can check VirusTotal results by clicking [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c7326852edc233e197ed015f0a787c0291a29eb8867f3ce033a360038545e14c/detection)

#### Why did you make this software when the data is publicly available?

Because the publicly stored data is in .NET and also it takes you approximately
6 hours to get and process data to an excel sheet, my software will do it in
2 minutes, so it would help everyone to calculate class average, CGPA, GPA etc, and store 
it in excel for further data processing, I believe this is the only software in the entire
internet that does this
