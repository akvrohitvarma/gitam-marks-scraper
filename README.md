# GITAM Marks Scraper

This software helps Individuals/Teachers to scrape and store marks
in an excel sheet to make it easier to view marks, calculate class average,
etc. This tool is built on a Command Line Interface, unlike my previous
tool [RONEE](https://akvrv.com/), I believe this type of Interface will be suitable for this
software since it reduces memory usage than compared to a
GUI with bells and whistles, this software is straight to point, 
easy and very powerful (I actually made a lot of effort to optimize)

This Software is Free to Use as an individual, but modifying, tampering
this software is a serious offence

I did not intend to include any trojan, backdoor or ransomware to
this software, if your antivirus detects that my software is malicious
it is purely a fluke, I do not intend to cause harm to any individual/system
